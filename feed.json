There are ways we can improve our site around that.</li>\n<li>I didn't record the conversations because I wanted our customers to be very comfortable with answering questions, because I asked a lot of questions.

The product manager and I had several sessions talking with customers, in group sessions and individual usability testing, and one thing that stuck out was that they did not trust our recommendations for insurance plans. As one customer put it, \"How can you recommend something for me when you know so little about me?\"</p>\n<p>We met also with our Customer Care reps and listened in on many phone calls with customers. It was clear that the their sales process was more conversational, and they asked more questions than the website did.</p>\n<p>We set some objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get users to trust our recommendations.</li>\n<li>Create a more conversational experience that felt more human than typical insurance transactions.</li>\n<li>Simplify the process wherever possible.</li>\n<li>Create an architecture that would empower us to a/b test any element on any screen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I mapped out a new user flow, working closely with our Customer Care reps and our insurance analysts.

The UX team wanted to create a living definition of the styles and components that would increase the collaboration between designers and developers; a.k.a., a design system.</p>\n<p>We looked at various design system tools, from Invision's <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/design-system-manager\" title=\"Invision's Design System Manager\">Design System Manager</a> to our own instranet (<a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence\" title=\"Atlassian's Confluence software\">Confluence</a>) to open-source projects like <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/\" title=\"Storybook tool for building UI components\">Storybook</a>. While we would have liked the polish of Design System Manager, we wanted to work more collaboratively with developers. We weren't able to implement Storybook just yet, so we settled on developing the system in GitLab using Markdown. We plan to use a tool like Storybook eventually.</p>\n<p>We wanted to structure the design system logically, around component-based development. We modeled the design system after Brad Frost's <a href=\"https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/\" title=\"Brad Frost's writing on Atomic Design\">Atomic Design methodology</a>. He and Dan Mall spoke at the <a href=\"https://artifactconf.com/\" title=\"Artifact Conference website\">Artifact Conference</a> in Austin, and we were inspired by Dan when he said (something like), \"A design system can be just two components.\" That gave us some courage after we had spent hours looking at all the big and fancy designs systems.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alysondesmarais.com/\" title=\"Alyson Desmarais's portfolio site\">Alyson Desmarais</a> was instrumental in building our design system, writing specs and digging deep into the accessibility standards (WCAG Level AA) for each component.

We assessed opportunities and risks, including the competition. We analyzed our capabilities, where we were strong and where we needed to be strong.</p>\n<p>We then assigned owners to our core capability areas and those folks defined their objectives and key results (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR\" title=\"OKRs explained on Wikipedia\">OKRs</a>), created by Intel's Andy Grove and made popular by Google.  We then critiqued the OKRs as a team and shored them up.</p>\n<p>After our strategy was reviewed and tweaked, I put it all together in a presentation that our CEO gave to the company. At the end of the meeting, we had all the employees work in teams to provide feedback for us. We got great feedback and, just as important, increased everyone's understanding of the strategy and their buy-in.</p>\n<p>I can't share the final presentation, of course, but here are a few slides:</p>\n<div class=\"gallery\"   >\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://christopherjacks.github.io/christopherjacks/media/posts/20/gallery/SMART-Strategy-v6.001.png\" ><img src=\"https://christopherjacks.github.io/christopherjacks/media/posts/20/gallery/SMART-Strategy-v6.001-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"Cover slide\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">The presentation cover slide.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://christopherjacks.github.io/christopherjacks/media/posts/20/gallery/SMART-Strategy-v6.007.png\" ><img src=\"https://christopherjacks.github.io/christopherjacks/media/posts/20/gallery/SMART-Strategy-v6.007-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"Strategic problem statement\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">Our strategic problem.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://christopherjacks.github.io/christopherjacks/media/posts/20/gallery/SMART-Strategy-v6.018.png\" ><img src=\"https://christopherjacks.github.io/christopherjacks/media/posts/20/gallery/SMART-Strategy-v6.018-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"High-level activities map\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">The high-level activities map in Scorecard format.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://christopherjacks.github.io/christopherjacks/media/posts/20/gallery/SMART-Strategy-v6.023.png\" ><img src=\"https://christopherjacks.github.io/christopherjacks/media/posts/20/gallery/SMART-Strategy-v6.023-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"Detailed activities map\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">Detailed map for the Deliver Better activity.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e49973l70\">What I learned</h2>\n<p>This was my second time leading a company strrategy exercise. Both times, there was some resistance to learning a new way to think about strategy. Both times, I had to listen closely to the resistance, make sure people felt heard, and show the value this method offered. Both times, I learned more how to influence without authority.</p>\n<p>Strategy is hard. You have to take a position, make trade-offs, be able to say No, and make all the pieces fit. It's no wonder some companies short-cut their strategic planning. In this go round, I learned also how to stay patient and stay determined when discussions get hard.</p>\n<p> </p>",

They want you to start work on putting together requirements for a brand-new piece of software that will be web based and will allow our clients to send and receive protected health information to and from clinical laboratories. The clinical laboratory we're integrating with has an established, well-documented API that sends and accepts messages in the HL7 format.</p>\n<p>Each clinic must be able to:</p>\n<ol style=\"margin-top: .25em;\">\n<li>Collect a sample of blood from a patient, label it with a unique ID, send that ID, the type of sample collected (blood), and the test panels requested (Chem7, CBC, Tox Screen,…) to the laboratory.</li>\n<li>Schedule a pickup of the physical samples.</li>\n<li>Receive the results of the test panels back, flag any positive drug results for individual patients, and display them in the Smart UI.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In order to successfully complete this exercise, you will need to provide Smart with the business logic surrounding the interactions for at least two of the features described above, identify the classes of users and write a brief persona for at least two of them, and provide a set of user stories and/or epics that you think will allow engineering to start the grooming process.</p>\n<p>No Smart resources are available to you for this exercise. Only publicly available information can be used to complete this task. The goal of this exercise is NOT to have a set of requirements that Smart can actually use to build a product, but is instead a chance for you to demonstrate your research, analysis, and communication abilities, along with your understanding of the software design process.</p>\n</div>\n<p>In the few days I had for the exercise, I researched Smart Management (especially their products), learned some about the standards and terminology for EHRs, read about how opioid recovery centers work, and researched the problems and complaints with EHRs in general. I wanted to start my pitch by focusing on problems and not just a typical workflow.</p>\n<p>I mapped the process in a <a href=\"https://trello.com/b/VvZa1rhH/test-to-treatment\" title=\"View the Trello board for this project\">Trello board</a>, using columns to represent the steps in the workflow. I added roles and a few simple personas. Then I added user stories for each step, assigning each step or task to a role. For a few of the user stories, I added the business logic or acceptance criteria.</p>\n<p>After I had enough of the workflow mapped out for the exercise I put together a presentation for the upcoming interview, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>problem statements,</li>\n<li>a product brief,</li>\n<li>some examples of better medical interfaces for inspiration,</li>\n<li>the roles and personas,</li>\n<li>a screenshot of and link to the user stories in Trello.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here's the presentation deck:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image\" ><a href=\"test=to=treatment-presentation.pdf\"><img style=\"border: 1px solid gray;\" src=\"https://christopherjacks.github.io/christopherjacks/media/posts/23/test-to-treatment-title-slide.png\" alt=\"Title slide for the presentation\" width=\"2044\" height=\"1534\"></a>\n<figcaption >Click to open the presentation as a <a href=\"test=to=treatment-presentation.pdf\">PDF file</a>.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The presentation went well, and I got the job.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e5at3jbo0\">What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned that like most industries, the electronic health record space is (way) more complicated than it might seem. I learned also that it is ripe for improvement, but it does depend on the larger health industry and changes there seem even harder.</p>\n<p>As a product manager doing this exercise in such a short timeframe, I learned that I can a good start toward solving a problem in a pressure situation.</p>\n<p> </p>",

I worked with <a href=\"https://studioworthy.com/\" title=\"Ben Ferreira's portfolio site.\">Ben Ferreira</a> on this project. Ben is a talented designer and thinker.</p>\n<p>Here's how we approached the discovery project:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We interviewed 23 people from the leadership, program, finance, project management, technology, and analysis teams.</li>\n<li>We compiled our notes, listed 181 problems that people told us about, and identified which roles were affected by which problems.</li>\n<li>We used affinity grouping to categorize the problems, de-duped the list, and prioritized the list.</li>\n<li>We selected the top 25 problems in the following categories:\n<ul>\n<li>Data</li>\n<li>Resources</li>\n<li>Reports</li>\n<li>Estimating</li>\n<li>Efficiency</li>\n<li>Culture</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We drafted some principles for the new project management system, for the system overall and for each of the above categories.</li>\n<li>We put together a presentation for the leadership team and presented our findings.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here is the presentation.

They also appreciated that the system principles we defined could serve as a high-level requirements list for RFPs and for kicking off the project.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e4m2kspg0\">What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>People love talking about their problems, unless they think no one is going to really listen. We had to overcome that distrust with some folks.</li>\n<li>The last question we asked each interviewee was, If you could have any superpower to do your job, what would it be? I thought that it would be a fun way to end the interviews. It was a great question, though. When several people selected Mindreading for their superpower, for example, we knew communication was an important theme.</li>\n<li>We could have done the initial research using a survey rather than interviews. We would have gotten more data, but we would have missed the conversations. People said things that we wouldn't haved thought to ask about. Secondly, we were getting buy-in to the research project with each interviewee, which was especially important at the leadership level.</li>\n</ul>",
