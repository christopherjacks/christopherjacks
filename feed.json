            "content_html": "<p>In 2018 I worked at Smart Management, an electronic health records (EHR) software vendor for opioid clinics. Our strategy was not well-defined and we spent most of our time putting out fires. I pitched and was given the opportunity to lead a business strategy discovery process with the leadership team.</p>\n<p>I had used the <a href=\"https://hbr.org/books/playing-to-win\" title=\"The Playing to Win book from HBR.\">Playing to Win</a> strategy framework a few years back when I was at InsureMyTrip, where it proved to be a useful framework. Playing to Win was created by <a href=\"https://rogerlmartin.com/\" title=\"Roger Martin's personal site\">Roger Martin</a> when he was at Monitor Group and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.G._Lafley\" title=\"A.G. Lafley's bio on Wikipedia\">A.G. Lafley</a> when he was leading Procter &amp; Gamble. It focuses on defining the area in which you will compete and assessing your capabilities and needs for how you will win. It's a flexible framework which can be cascaded throughout an organization, to ensure alignment from top to bottom.</p>\n<p>I designed a workshop to introduce Playing to Win to the leadersship team and begin our strategy work, with the following presentation. The workshop took place over 3 days, so the presentation is long, with examples meant to be reviewed between meetings:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image\" ><a href=\"p2w-training-presentation.PDF\" title=\"The Playing To Win training presentation\"><img src=\"https://christopherjacks.github.io/christopherjacks/media/posts/20/P2W-Workshop-Day-2.001.png\" alt=\"The cover page from the training deck for Smart Managemenet's strategy planning\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"></a>\n<figcaption >Click the above image to view the presentation as a <a href=\"p2w-training-presentation.PDF\" title=\"The Playing To Win training presentation\">PDF file</a>.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>After the training, we spent several weeks determining where we wanted to play and how we might win. We assessed opportunities and risks, including the competition. We analyzed our capabilities, where we were strong and where we needed to be strong.</p>\n<p>We then assigned owners to our core capability areas and those folks defined their objectives and key results (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR\" title=\"OKRs explained on Wikipedia\">OKRs</a>), created by Intel's Andy Grove and made popular by Google.  We then critiqued the OKRs as a team and shored them up.</p>\n<p>After our strategy was reviewed and tweaked, I put it all together in a presentation that our CEO gave to the company. At the end of the meeting, we had all the employees work in teams to provide feedback for us. We got great feedback and, just as important, increased everyone's understanding of the strategy and their buy-in.</p>\n<p>I can't share the final presentation, of course, but here are a few slides:</p>\n<div class=\"gallery\"   >\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://christopherjacks.github.io/christopherjacks/media/posts/20/gallery/SMART-Strategy-v6.001.png\" ><img src=\"https://christopherjacks.github.io/christopherjacks/media/posts/20/gallery/SMART-Strategy-v6.001-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"Cover slide\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">The presentation cover slide.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://christopherjacks.github.io/christopherjacks/media/posts/20/gallery/SMART-Strategy-v6.007.png\" ><img src=\"https://christopherjacks.github.io/christopherjacks/media/posts/20/gallery/SMART-Strategy-v6.007-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"Strategic problem statement\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">Our strategic problem.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://christopherjacks.github.io/christopherjacks/media/posts/20/gallery/SMART-Strategy-v6.018.png\" ><img src=\"https://christopherjacks.github.io/christopherjacks/media/posts/20/gallery/SMART-Strategy-v6.018-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"High-level activities map\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">The high-level activities map in Scorecard format.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://christopherjacks.github.io/christopherjacks/media/posts/20/gallery/SMART-Strategy-v6.023.png\" ><img src=\"https://christopherjacks.github.io/christopherjacks/media/posts/20/gallery/SMART-Strategy-v6.023-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"Detailed activities map\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a>\n<figcaption class=\"gallery-description\">Detailed map for the Deliver Better activity.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e49973l70\">What I learned</h2>\n<p>This was my second time leading a company strrategy exercise. Both times, there was some resistance to learning a new way to think about strategy. Both times, I had to listen closely to the resistance, make sure people felt heard, and show the value this method offered. Both times, I learned more how to influence without authority.</p>\n<p>Strategy is hard. You have to take a position, make trade-offs, be able to say No, and make all the pieces fit. It's no wonder some companies short-cut their strategic planning. In this go round, I learned also how to stay patient and stay determined when discussions get hard.</p>\n<p> </p>",

I recommend practicing at least a few times before your first actual interview.</li>\n<li>A lot of what happens for our customers during the purchase process doesn't occur on our website. There are ways we can improve our site around that.</li>\n<li>I didn't record the conversations because I wanted our customers to be very comfortable with answering questions, because I asked a lot of questions. Next time, I'd try recording the conversations, because I'd like to share the recordings internally, because more of us in the company should be listening in.</li>\n</ul>",

The product manager and I had several sessions talking with customers, in group sessions and individual usability testing, and one thing that stuck out was that they did not trust our recommendations for insurance plans. As one customer put it, \"How can you recommend something for me when you know so little about me?\"</p>\n<p>We met also with our Customer Care reps and listened in on many phone calls with customers. It was clear that the their sales process was more conversational, and they asked more questions than the website did.</p>\n<p>We set some objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get users to trust our recommendations.</li>\n<li>Create a more conversational experience that felt more human than typical insurance transactions.</li>\n<li>Simplify the process wherever possible.</li>\n<li>Create an architecture that would empower us to a/b test any element on any screen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I mapped out a new user flow, working closely with our Customer Care reps and our insurance analysts.

While we would have liked the polish of Design System Manager, we wanted to work more collaboratively with developers. We weren't able to implement Storybook just yet, so we settled on developing the system in GitLab using Markdown. We plan to use a tool like Storybook eventually.</p>\n<p>We wanted to structure the design system logically, around component-based development. We modeled the design system after Brad Frost's <a href=\"https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/\" title=\"Brad Frost's writing on Atomic Design\">Atomic Design methodology</a>. He and Dan Mall spoke at the <a href=\"https://artifactconf.com/\" title=\"Artifact Conference website\">Artifact Conference</a> in Austin, and we were inspired by Dan when he said (something like), \"A design system can be just two components.\" That gave us some courage after we had spent hours looking at all the big and fancy designs systems.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alysondesmarais.com/\" title=\"Alyson Desmarais's portfolio site\">Alyson Desmarais</a> was instrumental in building our design system, writing specs and digging deep into the accessibility standards (WCAG Level AA) for each component.

They also appreciated that the system principles we defined could serve as a high-level requirements list for RFPs and for kicking off the project.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1e4m2kspg0\">What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>People love talking about their problems, unless they think no one is going to really listen. We had to overcome that distrust with some folks.</li>\n<li>The last question we asked each interviewee was, If you could have any superpower to do your job, what would it be? I thought that it would be a fun way to end the interviews. It was a great question, though. When several people selected Mindreading for their superpower, for example, we knew communication was an important theme.</li>\n<li>We could have done the initial research using a survey rather than interviews. We would have gotten more data, but we would have missed the conversations. People said things that we wouldn't haved thought to ask about. Secondly, we were getting buy-in to the research project with each interviewee, which was especially important at the leadership level.</li>\n</ul>",

What was built was something different and didn't do well and, for business reasons, was pulled from the market.</code></pre>\n<div class=\"align-left\"> </div>\n<div class=\"align-left\">Sometime after completing the InsureMyTrip website redesign project and handing the new website off to another product manager, I was tasked with creating InsureMyTrip's first mobile application. Like the website redesign project, I envisioned putting together a great team, building a great product, and then passing that product and team off to someone else to continue evolving our mobile solutions. I called the project Mobility rather than Mobile because I wanted the team and the organization to never forget that the app was going to be used in mobile moments that happened everywhere.</div>\n<div class=\"align-left\"> </div>\n<div class=\"align-left\">Mobile moments are a good segue to performance. The most common mobile moment is to check your phone while you're waiting. And nobody wants to wait while they're waiting. That's painful twice fold. The mobile app had to perform very well. I grew up before automated teller machines and rejoiced at the convenience they provided. For about a week. Then I found myself tapping my foot impatiently while the ATM took   too   long. Speed makes haste?</div>\n<div class=\"align-left\"> </div>\n<div class=\"align-left\">Performance was important, too, because I expected a lot of our people to use this app (eventually). I was aiming big. I didn't want to create a mobile app that just copied our website. I didn't want to create an app that looked like any other travel insurance app. <span class=\"bold\">I wanted to use the mobile app to change how people thought of and used travel insurance</span>.</div>\n<div class=\"align-left\"> </div>\n<div class=\"align-left\">Most people use travel insurance in one of two ways: 1) They make travel plans. They buy travel insurance. They leave on their trip. Nothing goes wrong. They come home. Or 2) They make travel plans. They buy travel insurance. The leave on their trip. Something goes wrong. They come home. They file a claim.</div>\n<div class=\"align-left\"> </div>\n<div class=\"align-left\">What many travelers don't realize is that most travel insurance plans come with 24/7 assistance while they're traveling. Not just for when something goes wrong, but also for when they want to find a reliable place to exchange currency or want help getting exclusive theater tickets. If travel insurance was used more often by more people during their trips, more people would see more value in travel insurance. And they'd tell two people. And so on.</div>\n<div class=\"align-left\"> </div>\n<div class=\"align-left\">I set a product roadmap for our travel insurance mobile app that would surface the assistance provided by the travel insurance companies and also provide new types of assistance from InsureMyTrip, such as destination information guides and real-time, peer-to-peer recommendations. And this is where I have to stop myself from going into details about the ideas.</div>\n<div class=\"align-left\"> </div>\n<div class=\"align-left\">I set another lofty goal for the project not just to produce a mobile app but to become someday the mobile backbone for travel insurance, for other insurance companies and for other travel apps. My thinking about the backbone was influenced by many sources, including FastCo's \"<a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3031237/facebook-everywhere\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Facebook's Plan to Own your Phone</a>,\" which included this quote: \"Whenever and wherever you are thirsty, Coca-Cola will be there for you. Zuck wants Facebook to be just like that.\"</div>\n<div class=\"align-left\"> </div>\n<div class=\"align-left\">We worked hard thinking through our ambitious objectives, our customers, all their use cases, and how to keep the experience of a complex system simple. We filled up every whiteboard we could fit in the room with project principles, quotes for inspirations, lists and lists of ideas, sketchy wireframes, requirements, and the like. I believed that a different mobile app from InsureMyTrip could change travel insurance and help more people have better trips.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
