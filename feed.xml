                <p>In 2018 I worked at Smart Management, an electronic health records (EHR) software vendor for opioid clinics. Our strategy was not well-defined and we spent most of our time putting out fires. I pitched and was given the opportunity to lead a business strategy discovery process with the leadership team.</p>
<p>I had used the <a href="https://hbr.org/books/playing-to-win" title="The Playing to Win book from HBR.">Playing to Win</a> strategy framework a few years back when I was at InsureMyTrip, where it proved to be a useful framework. Playing to Win was created by <a href="https://rogerlmartin.com/" title="Roger Martin's personal site">Roger Martin</a> when he was at Monitor Group and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.G._Lafley" title="A.G. Lafley's bio on Wikipedia">A.G. Lafley</a> when he was leading Procter &amp; Gamble. It focuses on defining the area in which you will compete and assessing your capabilities and needs for how you will win. It's a flexible framework which can be cascaded throughout an organization, to ensure alignment from top to bottom.</p>
<p>I designed a workshop to introduce Playing to Win to the leadersship team and begin our strategy work, with the following presentation. The workshop took place over 3 days, so the presentation is long, with examples meant to be reviewed between meetings:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image" ><a href="p2w-training-presentation.PDF" title="The Playing To Win training presentation"><img src="https://christopherjacks.github.io/christopherjacks/media/posts/20/P2W-Workshop-Day-2.001.png" alt="The cover page from the training deck for Smart Managemenet's strategy planning" width="1024" height="768"></a>
<figcaption >Click the above image to view the presentation as a <a href="p2w-training-presentation.PDF" title="The Playing To Win training presentation">PDF file</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After the training, we spent several weeks determining where we wanted to play and how we might win. We assessed opportunities and risks, including the competition. We analyzed our capabilities, where we were strong and where we needed to be strong.</p>
<p>We then assigned owners to our core capability areas and those folks defined their objectives and key results (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR" title="OKRs explained on Wikipedia">OKRs</a>), created by Intel's Andy Grove and made popular by Google.  We then critiqued the OKRs as a team and shored them up.</p>
<p>After our strategy was reviewed and tweaked, I put it all together in a presentation that our CEO gave to the company. At the end of the meeting, we had all the employees work in teams to provide feedback for us. We got great feedback and, just as important, increased everyone's understanding of the strategy and their buy-in.</p>
<p>I can't share the final presentation, of course, but here are a few slides:</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1e49973l70">What I learned</h2>
<p>This was my second time leading a company strrategy exercise. Both times, there was some resistance to learning a new way to think about strategy. Both times, I had to listen closely to the resistance, make sure people felt heard, and show the value this method offered. Both times, I learned more how to influence without authority.</p>
<p>Strategy is hard. You have to take a position, make trade-offs, be able to say No, and make all the pieces fit. It's no wonder some companies short-cut their strategic planning. In this go round, I learned also how to stay patient and stay determined when discussions get hard.</p>

                <p>At InsureMyTrip the product manager asked the UX team to do research into how customers used our site, specifically how they got insurance quotes. I jumped at the chance to spend some more time talking with our customers.</p>
<p>We set the recruiting criteria, selected participants with various backgrounds, but ended up interviewing just 4 customers due to a change in priorities at the company level. We still learned a good number of ways we could better help people find the right travel insurance, so we put together our findings to share with the product manager and also the scrum team who eventually would work on our new quote process.</p>
<p>Here's a screenshot of the notes that came out of the interviews:</p>
<p><img class="post__image" style="border: 1px solid gray;" src="https://christopherjacks.github.io/christopherjacks/media/posts/19/convex-jtbd-interviews.png" alt="A screenshot of the interview notes." width="1750" height="1754"></p>
<p>I then put highlights from the notes into a format like empathy maps, but instead of the "Say | Think | Do | Feel" categories, I used the Jobs To Be Done categories of "Habit | Anxiety | Push | Pull." Jobs To Be Done is a great framework for interviewing customers to figure out what motivates them to buy or not buy your products. To learn more, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfGtw2C95Ms" title="Clayton Christensen explains how to understand the job your customer is hiring your product to do.">Clayton </a><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfGtw2C95Ms" title="Clayton Christensen explains how to understand the job your customer is hiring your product to do.">Christensen explain how to understand the job</a> (a.k.a., the Milkshake Video).</span></p>
<p>Here is the presentation we used to share our findings with the business folks and the technical folks:</p>

<p>You also can view the presentation as a <a href="convex-jtbd-empathy-maps.pdf">PDF file</a>.</p>
<p>I learned several things from this research:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jobs To Be Done does help you understand better how your customers think, but it takes some practice to get the interviewing right. I recommend practicing at least a few times before your first actual interview.</li>
<li>A lot of what happens for our customers during the purchase process doesn't occur on our website. There are ways we can improve our site around that.</li>
<li>I didn't record the conversations because I wanted our customers to be very comfortable with answering questions, because I asked a lot of questions. Next time, I'd try recording the conversations, because I'd like to share the recordings internally, because more of us in the company should be listening in.</li>

                <p>The first large project I took on since returning to InsureMyTrip was to rethink the quoting process of our website. The product manager and I had several sessions talking with customers, in group sessions and individual usability testing, and one thing that stuck out was that they did not trust our recommendations for insurance plans. As one customer put it, "How can you recommend something for me when you know so little about me?"</p>
<p>We met also with our Customer Care reps and listened in on many phone calls with customers. It was clear that the their sales process was more conversational, and they asked more questions than the website did.</p>
<p>We set some objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get users to trust our recommendations.</li>
<li>Create a more conversational experience that felt more human than typical insurance transactions.</li>
<li>Simplify the process wherever possible.</li>
<li>Create an architecture that would empower us to a/b test any element on any screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>I mapped out a new user flow, working closely with our Customer Care reps and our insurance analysts. I created a user flow diagram that I updated throughout the project:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image" ><a href="convex-screen-flow-diagram.pdf"><img style="border: 1px solid gray;" src="https://christopherjacks.github.io/christopherjacks/media/posts/18/convex-screen-flow-diagram.png" alt="The new user flow for the redesigned quote process." width="3358" height="10932"></a>
<figcaption >Click the image to view the flow as a <a href="convex-screen-flow-diagram.pdf">PDF file</a> (for easier zooming, etc.).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We followed LukeW's <a href="https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933" title="The original mobile-first design concepts from Luke Wroblewski">mobile-first design</a> methods for this project, because our mobile traffic share is exploding, so we want to make sure we get it right on mobile and not just downsize a laptop experience. Second, by designing for the smaller screen first, we have to jettison what's unnecessary, which will help us keep the experience simple across all devices.</p>
<p>Here are a few screens from the mobile designs:</p>

                <p>At InsureMyTrip design documentation was stored mainly in individual documents in Google docs. They weren't easily found and were updated rarely. The UX team wanted to create a living definition of the styles and components that would increase the collaboration between designers and developers; a.k.a., a design system.</p>
<p>We looked at various design system tools, from Invision's <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/design-system-manager" title="Invision's Design System Manager">Design System Manager</a> to our own instranet (<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence" title="Atlassian's Confluence software">Confluence</a>) to open-source projects like <a href="https://storybook.js.org/" title="Storybook tool for building UI components">Storybook</a>. While we would have liked the polish of Design System Manager, we wanted to work more collaboratively with developers. We weren't able to implement Storybook just yet, so we settled on developing the system in GitLab using Markdown. We plan to use a tool like Storybook eventually.</p>
<p>We wanted to structure the design system logically, around component-based development. We modeled the design system after Brad Frost's <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/" title="Brad Frost's writing on Atomic Design">Atomic Design methodology</a>. He and Dan Mall spoke at the <a href="https://artifactconf.com/" title="Artifact Conference website">Artifact Conference</a> in Austin, and we were inspired by Dan when he said (something like), "A design system can be just two components." That gave us some courage after we had spent hours looking at all the big and fancy designs systems.</p>
<p><a href="http://alysondesmarais.com/" title="Alyson Desmarais's portfolio site">Alyson Desmarais</a> was instrumental in building our design system, writing specs and digging deep into the accessibility standards (WCAG Level AA) for each component. She's amazing.</p>
<p>Here are some screenshots from the GitLab repository:</p>

                <p>When I rejoined InsureMyTrip, we didn't have a good cadence for including UX in their Scrum flow. I worked with the scrum master and product owner to define the process, reviewed it with stakeholders and the development teams, and got it going.</p>
<p>A lot has been written about incorporating design tasks in Scrum. We decided on a parallel process with a number of checkins, including <a href="https://42floors.com/blog/startups/thirty-percent-feedback" title="A blog post about getting feedback early in a process.">30/60/90% reviews</a>. We managed our design tasks in a separate workflow, because they had different gates than a typical 2-week sprint. We also made sure that our work was represented in the teams' workflows, to increase transparency.</p>
<p>We designed this workflow for non-project tickets, for maintenance work, new features, and a/b tests we ran on the current site. For a long project, we would modify the flow to fit how the team worked, and most likely do more concurrent design.</p>
<p>Here is the workflow:</p>

                <p>While I was at Mojotech we consulted with Amica Insurance as they were starting an innovation program. Mike Davis and I shared some ideas and things to consider as they ramped up.</p>
<p>One of my tasks was to diagram the innovation funnel. My first step was research. Here are some notes I took:</p>

<p>I then created a spreadsheet to map out the process:</p>

<p>I took the most important points from the spreadsheet and created the following diagram that was included in our presentation:</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1e4oj8k270">What I learned</h2>
<p>Being a designer and a product manager, I've been responsible for innovation efforts for a variety of programs and products. For this presentation, I got the chance to look at the innovation process from a more theoretical view and study how different companies approached innovation.</p>
<p>When I started putting together my ideas, it helped to think of the innovation process in two parts: governance and development. They have different processes, with different roles and different objectives.</p>

                    <img src="https://christopherjacks.github.io/christopherjacks/media/posts/21/Workforce-Discovery-Presentation-v2.005.png" alt="Problems list from the MIT Project Management Discovery presentation." />
                <p>MIT's IT leadership team asked the UX team to uncover the problems in our project processes for an upcoming project management tool implementation across the department. I worked with <a href="https://studioworthy.com/" title="Ben Ferreira's portfolio site.">Ben Ferreira</a> on this project. Ben is a talented designer and thinker.</p>
<p>Here's how we approached the discovery project:</p>
<ol>
<li>We interviewed 23 people from the leadership, program, finance, project management, technology, and analysis teams.</li>
<li>We compiled our notes, listed 181 problems that people told us about, and identified which roles were affected by which problems.</li>
<li>We used affinity grouping to categorize the problems, de-duped the list, and prioritized the list.</li>
<li>We selected the top 25 problems in the following categories:
<ul>
<li>Data</li>
<li>Resources</li>
<li>Reports</li>
<li>Estimating</li>
<li>Efficiency</li>
<li>Culture</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We drafted some principles for the new project management system, for the system overall and for each of the above categories.</li>
<li>We put together a presentation for the leadership team and presented our findings.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the presentation. It's a bit plain, but that worked fine for our technical audience who preferred to focus on data:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image" ><a href="MIT-project-management-discovery-presentation.pdf"><img style="border: 1px solid gray;" src="https://christopherjacks.github.io/christopherjacks/media/posts/21/Workforce-Discovery-Presentation-v2.001.png" alt="Cover page of the MIT Project Management Discovery presentation." width="1024" height="768"></a>
<figcaption >Click the image to view the presentation as a <a href="MIT-project-management-discovery-presentation.pdf">PDF file</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e4m2q6681">Results</h2>
<p>Members of the leadership team said they were glad to have a list of problems against which they could measure potential project management solutions. They also appreciated that the system principles we defined could serve as a high-level requirements list for RFPs and for kicking off the project.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e4m2kspg0">What I learned</h2>
<p>I learned the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>People love talking about their problems, unless they think no one is going to really listen. We had to overcome that distrust with some folks.</li>
<li>The last question we asked each interviewee was, If you could have any superpower to do your job, what would it be? I thought that it would be a fun way to end the interviews. It was a great question, though. When several people selected Mindreading for their superpower, for example, we knew communication was an important theme.</li>
<li>We could have done the initial research using a survey rather than interviews. We would have gotten more data, but we would have missed the conversations. People said things that we wouldn't haved thought to ask about. Secondly, we were getting buy-in to the research project with each interviewee, which was especially important at the leadership level.</li>

<div>Shortly after joining MIT's IS&amp;T department to lead their UX team, I worked with the team to define our discovery process. Because UX was a new group at IS&amp;T, it was important to evangelize and show how we worked and the value we added to projects.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The current process was, mostly, that the project managers asked what the departments wanted and we built that. The head of IS&amp;T explained to me that it wasn't working. I wasn't surprised.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The process we defined looked like this:</div>

<div class="sub-title">
<pre class="align-left"><code>Note: This post just describes the product objectives, because I left InsureMyTrip before we got to design deliverables or the app was built. What was built was something different and didn't do well and, for business reasons, was pulled from the market.</code></pre>
<div class="align-left"> </div>
<div class="align-left">Sometime after completing the InsureMyTrip website redesign project and handing the new website off to another product manager, I was tasked with creating InsureMyTrip's first mobile application. Like the website redesign project, I envisioned putting together a great team, building a great product, and then passing that product and team off to someone else to continue evolving our mobile solutions. I called the project Mobility rather than Mobile because I wanted the team and the organization to never forget that the app was going to be used in mobile moments that happened everywhere.</div>
<div class="align-left"> </div>
<div class="align-left">Mobile moments are a good segue to performance. The most common mobile moment is to check your phone while you're waiting. And nobody wants to wait while they're waiting. That's painful twice fold. The mobile app had to perform very well. I grew up before automated teller machines and rejoiced at the convenience they provided. For about a week. Then I found myself tapping my foot impatiently while the ATM took   too   long. Speed makes haste?</div>
<div class="align-left"> </div>
<div class="align-left">Performance was important, too, because I expected a lot of our people to use this app (eventually). I was aiming big. I didn't want to create a mobile app that just copied our website. I didn't want to create an app that looked like any other travel insurance app. <span class="bold">I wanted to use the mobile app to change how people thought of and used travel insurance</span>.</div>
<div class="align-left"> </div>
<div class="align-left">Most people use travel insurance in one of two ways: 1) They make travel plans. They buy travel insurance. They leave on their trip. Nothing goes wrong. They come home. Or 2) They make travel plans. They buy travel insurance. The leave on their trip. Something goes wrong. They come home. They file a claim.</div>
<div class="align-left"> </div>
<div class="align-left">What many travelers don't realize is that most travel insurance plans come with 24/7 assistance while they're traveling. Not just for when something goes wrong, but also for when they want to find a reliable place to exchange currency or want help getting exclusive theater tickets. If travel insurance was used more often by more people during their trips, more people would see more value in travel insurance. And they'd tell two people. And so on.</div>
<div class="align-left"> </div>
<div class="align-left">I set a product roadmap for our travel insurance mobile app that would surface the assistance provided by the travel insurance companies and also provide new types of assistance from InsureMyTrip, such as destination information guides and real-time, peer-to-peer recommendations. And this is where I have to stop myself from going into details about the ideas.</div>
<div class="align-left"> </div>
<div class="align-left">I set another lofty goal for the project not just to produce a mobile app but to become someday the mobile backbone for travel insurance, for other insurance companies and for other travel apps. My thinking about the backbone was influenced by many sources, including FastCo's "<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3031237/facebook-everywhere" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Facebook's Plan to Own your Phone</a>," which included this quote: "Whenever and wherever you are thirsty, Coca-Cola will be there for you. Zuck wants Facebook to be just like that."</div>
<div class="align-left"> </div>
<div class="align-left">We worked hard thinking through our ambitious objectives, our customers, all their use cases, and how to keep the experience of a complex system simple. We filled up every whiteboard we could fit in the room with project principles, quotes for inspirations, lists and lists of ideas, sketchy wireframes, requirements, and the like. I believed that a different mobile app from InsureMyTrip could change travel insurance and help more people have better trips.</div>
