                <p>The first large project I took on since returning to InsureMyTrip was to rethink the quoting process of our website. The product manager and I had several sessions talking with customers, in group sessions and individual usability testing, and one thing that stuck out was that they did not trust our recommendations for insurance plans. As one customer put it, "How can you recommend something for me when you know so little about me?"</p>
<p>We met also with our Customer Care reps and listened in on many phone calls with customers. It was clear that the their sales process was more conversational, and they asked more questions than the website did.</p>
<p>We set some objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get users to trust our recommendations.</li>
<li>Create a more conversational experience that felt more human than typical insurance transactions.</li>
<li>Simplify the process wherever possible.</li>
<li>Create an architecture that would empower us to a/b test any element on any screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>I mapped out a new user flow, working closely with our Customer Care reps and our insurance analysts. I created a user flow diagram that I updated throughout the project:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image" ><a href="convex-screen-flow-diagram.pdf"><img style="border: 1px solid gray;" src="https://christopherjacks.github.io/christopherjacks/media/posts/18/convex-screen-flow-diagram.png" alt="The new user flow for the redesigned quote process." width="3358" height="10932"></a>
<figcaption >Click the image to view the flow as a <a href="convex-screen-flow-diagram.pdf">PDF file</a> (for easier zooming, etc.).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We followed LukeW's <a href="https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933" title="The original mobile-first design concepts from Luke Wroblewski">mobile-first design</a> methods for this project, because our mobile traffic share is exploding, so we want to make sure we get it right on mobile and not just downsize a laptop experience. Second, by designing for the smaller screen first, we have to jettison what's unnecessary, which will help us keep the experience simple across all devices.</p>
<p>Here are a few screens from the mobile designs:</p>

                <p>At InsureMyTrip design documentation was stored mainly in individual documents in Google docs. They weren't easily found and were updated rarely. The UX team wanted to create a living definition of the styles and components that would increase the collaboration between designers and developers; a.k.a., a design system.</p>
<p>We looked at various design system tools, from Invision's <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/design-system-manager" title="Invision's Design System Manager">Design System Manager</a> to our own instranet (<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence" title="Atlassian's Confluence software">Confluence</a>) to open-source projects like <a href="https://storybook.js.org/" title="Storybook tool for building UI components">Storybook</a>. While we would have liked the polish of Design System Manager, we wanted to work more collaboratively with developers. We weren't able to implement Storybook just yet, so we settled on developing the system in GitLab using Markdown. We plan to use a tool like Storybook eventually.</p>
<p>We wanted to structure the design system logically, around component-based development. We modeled the design system after Brad Frost's <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/" title="Brad Frost's writing on Atomic Design">Atomic Design methodology</a>. He and Dan Mall spoke at the <a href="https://artifactconf.com/" title="Artifact Conference website">Artifact Conference</a> in Austin, and we were inspired by Dan when he said (something like), "A design system can be just two components." That gave us some courage after we had spent hours looking at all the big and fancy designs systems.</p>
<p><a href="http://alysondesmarais.com/" title="Alyson Desmarais's portfolio site">Alyson Desmarais</a> was instrumental in building our design system, writing specs and digging deep into the accessibility standards (WCAG Level AA) for each component. She's amazing.</p>
<p>Here are some screenshots from the GitLab repository:</p>

                <p class="align-left">If you have rules, you can make decisions only for problems that fit the rules. With principles, you can make any decisions. It's why a system like Agile is so flexible; there are no rules, just the principles outlined in the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/" title="The Agile Manifesto website">Agile manifesto</a>.</p>
<p class="align-left">I've had various sets of design principles through the years, changing them as technology and I have evolved.

                <p>When I rejoined InsureMyTrip, we didn't have a good cadence for including UX in their Scrum flow. I worked with the scrum master and product owner to define the process, reviewed it with stakeholders and the development teams, and got it going.</p>
<p>A lot has been written about incorporating design tasks in Scrum. We decided on a parallel process with a number of checkins, including <a href="https://42floors.com/blog/startups/thirty-percent-feedback" title="A blog post about getting feedback early in a process.">30/60/90% reviews</a>. We managed our design tasks in a separate workflow, because they had different gates than a typical 2-week sprint. We also made sure that our work was represented in the teams' workflows, to increase transparency.</p>
<p>We designed this workflow for non-project tickets, for maintenance work, new features, and a/b tests we ran on the current site. For a long project, we would modify the flow to fit how the team worked, and most likely do more concurrent design.</p>
<p>Here is the workflow:</p>

<div>Shortly after joining MIT's IS&amp;T department to lead their UX team, I worked with the team to define our discovery process. Because UX was a new group at IS&amp;T, it was important to evangelize and show how we worked and the value we added to projects.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The current process was, mostly, that the project managers asked what the departments wanted and we built that. The head of IS&amp;T explained to me that it wasn't working. I wasn't surprised.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The process we defined looked like this:</div>

<div class="sub-title">
<pre class="align-left"><code>Note: This description is just a description, because I left InsureMyTrip before the app was built. What was built was something different and didn't do well and, for business reasons, was pulled from the market.</code></pre>
<div class="align-left"> </div>
<div class="align-left">Sometime after completing the InsureMyTrip website redesign project and handing the new website off to another product manager, I was tasked with creating InsureMyTrip's first mobile application. Like the website redesign project, I envisioned putting together a great team, building a great product, and then passing that product and team off to someone else to continue evolving our mobile solutions. I called the project Mobility rather than Mobile because I wanted the team and the organization to never forget that the app was going to be used in mobile moments that happened everywhere.</div>
<div class="align-left"> </div>
<div class="align-left">Mobile moments are a good segue to performance. The most common mobile moment is to check your phone while you're waiting. And nobody wants to wait while they're waiting. That's painful twice fold. The mobile app had to perform very well. I grew up before automated teller machines and rejoiced at the convenience they provided. For about a week. Then I found myself tapping my foot impatiently while the ATM took   too   long. Speed makes haste?</div>
<div class="align-left"> </div>
<div class="align-left">Performance was important, too, because I expected a lot of our people to use this app (eventually). I was aiming big. I didn't want to create a mobile app that just copied our website. I didn't want to create an app that looked like any other travel insurance app. <span class="bold">I wanted to use the mobile app to change how people thought of and used travel insurance</span>.</div>
<div class="align-left"> </div>
<div class="align-left">Most people use travel insurance in one of two ways: 1) They make travel plans. They buy travel insurance. They leave on their trip. Nothing goes wrong. They come home. Or 2) They make travel plans. They buy travel insurance. The leave on their trip. Something goes wrong. They come home. They file a claim.</div>
<div class="align-left"> </div>
<div class="align-left">What many travelers don't realize is that most travel insurance plans come with 24/7 assistance while they're traveling. Not just for when something goes wrong, but also for when they want to find a reliable place to exchange currency or want help getting exclusive theater tickets. If travel insurance was used more often by more people during their trips, more people would see more value in travel insurance. And they'd tell two people. And so on.</div>
<div class="align-left"> </div>
<div class="align-left">I set a product roadmap for our travel insurance mobile app that would surface the assistance provided by the travel insurance companies and also provide new types of assistance from InsureMyTrip, such as destination information guides and real-time, peer-to-peer recommendations. And this is where I have to stop myself from going into details about the ideas.</div>
<div class="align-left"> </div>
<div class="align-left">I set another lofty goal for the project not just to produce a mobile app but to become someday the mobile backbone for travel insurance, for other insurance companies and for other travel apps. My thinking about the backbone was influenced by many sources, including FastCo's "<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3031237/facebook-everywhere" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Facebook's Plan to Own your Phone</a>," which included this quote: "Whenever and wherever you are thirsty, Coca-Cola will be there for you. Zuck wants Facebook to be just like that."</div>
<div class="align-left"> </div>
<div class="align-left">We worked hard thinking through our ambitious objectives, our customers, all their use cases, and how to keep the experience of a complex system simple. We filled up every whiteboard we could fit in the room with project principles, quotes for inspirations, lists and lists of ideas, sketchy wireframes, requirements, and the like. I believed that a different mobile app from InsureMyTrip could change travel insurance and help more people have better trips.</div>

                <div>One of the must-have requirements of the website redesign project for InsureMyTrip was to make the website work well on tablets and phones. Our traffic from mobile devices was around 15% and rising quickly. We used responsive web design to meet this demand and selected the Bootstrap framework. <a href="https://kanchev.com/" title="Hristo Kanchev's portfolio site">Hristo Kanchev</a>, a lead designer on the project, contributed greatly to our responsive design efforts.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We gathered mobile devices for on-the-fly testing but also used third-party services to ensure testing across a full-range of mobile platforms and manufacturers. We also built conversion funnels in Google Analytics specifically for tablets and phones. And we tested site performance on mobile devices. After all, performance is the first experience in any user experience.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Looking at our current mobile device statistics, we decided on two breakpoints for responsive design, one for tablets and one for phones. Additional design considerations included mobile design best practices such as ensuring that page elements stacked usefully on smaller screens and eliminating elements such as large-sized images that might hinder performance on cellular networks. We started planning a different quote and buy process for phones, but realized quickly we would not be able to get that done during the project timeline.</div>

<div class="align-left">At InsureMyTrip, I asked for the chance to rethink and redesign our high-traffic, e-commerce website. The website was outdated, not easy to update even for simple content changes, and lacked useful content and features like site search. Because it was ambitious, we called the project Super Redo.</div>

The skinny lot at 50 Broadway wouldn't allow for many stories (and not much income) with a stone building. The owner asked architects what could be done, and none had any ideas except for Bradford Gilbert, an architect of railroad stations (including Canton Junction, for you people local to Boston). He had seen a lot of railroad bridges and it occurred to him to turn one on its end: To use steel.</div>

I believed we could find a better way to help people find the right travel insurance for their trips by building a smarter, interactive solution. The above screenshot came from a website that did just that, for appliances: It helped you find the right part.</div>

<div class="sub-title">From the old logo on the first slide to a new logo, from the old website to the new website, we were reinventing things. I believe that is what good design and good work should do.</div>

<div class="sub-title">The new <a href="http://www.insuremytrip.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">InsureMyTrip website</a> launched fully in November, 2013 and resulted in a 15% increase in sales conversions (among other metric improvements). That felt pretty great.</div>

                <p>At InsureMyTrip I ptiched and led a project to add customer reviews to our website. To make sure the project team and management were heading in the same direction, I wrote the following product brief, reviewed it with stakeholders, and started our conversations in the kickoff meeting from it.</p>
